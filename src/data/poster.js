       "abstract":"The popularity of online learning, such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses), continues to increase among students. However, MOOCs dropout remains high and and considerable research aims to understand and predict student performance.  Such prediction can, for example, feed instructors dashboards, help them adapt their course structure and material, or trigger help and tailor interventions to specific groups of students.  This paper focuses on three metrics for how students interact with MOOC videos in order to predict which groups of students will pass or fail the course. These three metrics are: student attendance rate (AR), utilization rate (UR) and watching index (WI) of videos. They are taken after the first week and after the midpoint of the course. Results show that these metrics can be highly effective for predicting the students that will pass or fail the course."

       "abstract":"In the domain of moral education, students' need deficiency refers to the unsatisfied need that would result in problem behaviors. Timely and accurate identification of students' need deficiency is crucial to moral education and the students themselves. Previous psychology research focusing on distinct factors only provides scattered guidelines to identify such need deficiencies and meanwhile few teachers and parents have the related expertise, which makes the identification task difficult to accomplish. To address these issues, we develop a task-oriented dialogue system to help teachers and parents identify students' need deficiency through multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, an integrated framework summarizing all relevant factors of need deficiency is proposed, which provides a theoretical foundation for the newly proposed system. Guided by the theoretical framework, reinforcement learning methodology is adopted to learn dialogue policy to serve the designed dialogue system. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed dialogue system achieves its design objectives."

       "abstract":"Knowledge tracing is a well-established problem and non-trivial task in personalized education. In recent years, many existing works have been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task, particularly recurrent neural networks based methods, e.g., Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. However, we have noticed two major problems of DKT. The first problem is that DKT fails to reconstruct the observed input, which results in the prediction of knowledge state deceased even a student performs well in previous knowledge state. Second, the predicted performance for knowledge state across time-steps is not consistent. In this paper, we utilize a mathematical computation model named Finite State Automaton(FSA), which can change from one state to another in response to the external input, to interpret the hidden state transition of the DKT when receiving inputs. And we discover the root cause of the two problems is that the DKT can not handle the long sequence input with the help of FSA. Accordingly, we propose two effective attention-based models, which can solve these two problems by directly capturing the relationships among each item of the input regardless of the length of the input sequence. The experimental results show that our proposed models can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on several well-known corpora."

       "abstract":"Aiming to provide flexible, effective and personalized online learning service, micro learning has gained wide attention in recent years as more people turn to use fragment time to grasp fragmented knowledge. Widely available online knowledge sharing is one of the most representative approaches to micro learning, and it is well accepted by online learners. People spend a short time to get quick answers to small questions. However, information overload challenges such personalized online learning services, as redundant and useless information and resources should be filtered out during the ser-vice. In this paper, we propose a deep cross attention recommendation model to provide online users with personalized resources based on users’ profile and historical online behaviours. This model benefits from the deep neural network, feature crossing, and attention mechanism mutually. In our experi-ments, the proposed model was compared to several state-of-art recommen-dation strategies, and the proposed model showed greatly improved perfor-mance in both recommendation results and running efficiency."

Consequently, writers must select from a large array of idioms, vocabulary terms that are semantically equivalent, and discourse features that simultaneously reflect content and allow readers to grasp meaning. In many cases, a simplified version of a text is needed to ensure comprehension on the part of a targeted audience (e.g., second language learners). To address this need, we propose an automated method to simplify texts based on paraphrasing. Specifically, we explore the potential for a deep learning model, previously used for machine translation, to learn a simplified version of the English language within the context of short phrases. The best model based on a Transformer architecture achieves a BLEU score of 64.71. We also evaluate this model’s capability to perform similar transformation to texts that were simplified by human experts at different levels."

However, it is still unclear the approach to achieve higher learning gains and levels of satisfaction.

To empower learning, and for the first time in the literature, automatic emotion management, personalization and execution have been incorporated in the teaching of programming in Primary Education. 137 children between 10-12 years were randomly split into four groups who used different options of Alcody for three months: group A with personalization, execution and without emotions; group B with personalization, execution and emotions; group C without personalization, execution, emotion; and, group D without personalization, emotions and with execution. The results of a pre-post programming test indicate a statistic significant improvement in the scores of all groups. The higher improvement is registered for the students in group B, and the lower improvement is registered for the students in the group C. Moreover, the satisfaction levels gathered in a questionnaire filled in by the students and the teachers are also higher for students in group B."

However, few field studies have investigated data-driven hints' impact on students' performance and learning, or which students benefit most from these hints. In this work, we ran a controlled experiment with 241 students in an authentic classroom setting, comparing students who learned with and without hints. We found evidence of a significant interaction between students' prior knowledge and the effect of hints on performance and learning. High-prior-knowledge students performed better with hints, while low-prior-knowledge students performed worse with hints than without hints. While the effect of hints was not large for either group, our findings do add to a growing literature that sheds light on when it is helpful to tailor interventions to students' prior knowledge. Our results also suggest a reason why: data-driven hints may be better suited to address the simpler errors of students who are performing well."

       "abstract":"Learner models capture an abstract representation of a student's knowledge state. They are a key component of many educational learning systems, aiming to provide personalised feedback or adaptivity functionalities to enhance learning. Traditionally, learner models estimate a student's knowledge state solely based on their performance on attempting assessment items. This can be contributed to the fact that in many traditional educational systems, learners are prominently involved in just answering assessment items. In recent years, the use of crowdsourcing to support learning at scale has received significant attention in the Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) community. Crowdsourcing educational systems transform students' role from passive recipients of content to active participants where in addition to attempting learning items, they are engaged with multiple tasks such as creating resources, creating solutions, rating the quality of resources and giving feedback. Evidence from learning theories and learning science suggest that engaging students in such tasks may foster higher-order learning across many domains, which may lead to measurable learning gains. Given this evidence, this paper explores whether leveraging data from students' learning tasks beyond attempting assessment items can be used towards modelling the knowledge state of learners. Results from two empirical studies suggest that indeed crowdsourced contributions from students fosters learning and can effectively be used in modelling learners."

However, further improvement is required for high-stakes and large-scale examinations because even a small scoring error will affect many test-takers. To improve scoring accuracy, we propose a new ASAG method that combines a conventional DNN-ASAG model and an item response theory (IRT) model. Our method uses an IRT model to estimate the test-taker's ability from his/her true-false responses to objective questions that are offered with a target short-answer question in the same test. Then, the target short-answer score is predicted by jointly using the ability value and an embedding representation of the short-answer text, which is obtained as an intermediate hidden representation of a DNN-ASAG model. Because we assume that the short-answer questions and objective questions in the same test measure a similar ability, the ability estimated from the objective questions is expected to be useful for short-answer grading. To our knowledge, this is a new approach focusing on using responses for objective questions to grade short-answer questions."

By analyzing children's performance, we were able to make some assumptions for developing the robot's decision-making model in the future. In a study with 35 participants between the ages of 7 and 9, we observed that the majority of children selected an implicit egocentric perspective (without using 'my') for their first instruction.They were inclined to adjust their perspective to the robot, in order to successfully complete the task. And they created a mental model of the robot's perspective taking behaviour (e.g. I think the robot is egocentric) that helped them to perform the task better.Furthermore, the robot's change of frame of reference between the sessions was counterproductive to children's gameplay and success in completing the sessions."

Teachers have shared millions of resources online, producing a vast amount of data. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to study teachers in social media and potentially improve the quality of resource sharing amongst teachers. To perform such a study, we often begin with a sample of teachers from social media, and then leverage their shared resources and online connections to further investigate education-related research questions. However, there is a dark side -- data bias. In the context of teachers in social media, data bias means that identified/sampled teachers may not be representative of teachers in social media.  Such bias can be catastrophic and invalidates research findings and achievements. Thus, it is necessary to address data bias for teachers in social media and improve the representative nature of our sample. In this paper, we perform a thorough analysis of teachers on Pinterest. We surveyed 541 teachers in the United States and retrieved their online data as well as their social connections on Pinterest. Afterward, we introduced several characteristics helping us to investigate data bias for teachers in social media.

By modelling learners as Bayesian reasoners, individuals who weigh their prior belief against current circumstantial data to reach conclusions, it becomes possible to both generate estimates of learner performance and the impact of the educational environment on the learner in probabilistic terms. The model is demonstrated using both simulated data and a benchmark dataset. The algorithm generates estimates that behave as expected on simulated data and predict student performance with accuracy comparable to commonly utilized algorithms.

However, CAD is very challenging because (1) the CAD model needs to be generalized well enough for different teachers and students; (2) classroom recordings may be very noisy and low-quality; and (3) the solution should not heavily rely on additional recording device. In this work, we address the above challenges by building a Siamese neural framework to automatically identify teacher and student utterances from classroom recordings.

In a recent study, we found that while students experience more confusion and frustration (confrustion) when working with erroneous examples, they demonstrate better retention of decimal concepts. In this study, we investigated whether this finding could be replicated in a digital learning game. In the erroneous examples (ErrEx) version of the game, students saw a character play the games and make mistakes, and then they corrected their errors. In the problem solving (PS) version, students played the games by themselves. We divided participants into four conditions: an ErrEx-only condition, a PS-only condition, an ErrEx-PS condition with an ErrEx mini-game followed by a PS mini-game, and a PS-ErrEx condition with a PS mini-game followed by an ErrEx mini-game. We found that confrustion was significantly, negatively correlated with performance in both pretest (r = -.62, p < .001) and posttest (r = -.68, p < .001) and so was gaming the system (pretest r = -.58, p < .001, posttest r = -.66, p < .001). Posthoc (Tukey) tests indicated that students that did not see any erroneous examples (PS-only) experienced significantly lower levels of confrustion (p < .001) and gaming (p < .001). While we did not find significant differences in post-test performance across the four conditions, our findings show that students working with erroneous examples experience consistently higher levels of confrustion in both game and non-game contexts."

One reason for the higher scores is that students abuse error-flagging feedback to find the correct answer through trial and error even when the test is not multiple-choice in nature. A follow-up study found that even when a limit was placed on the number of revisions, students scored higher with error-flagging feedback than without during tests. A limit on the number of revisions may discourage students from using error-flagging feedback as a substitute for their own judgment. In this study, we evaluated whether the number of revisions allowed per problem when error-flagging feedback is provided has a significant effect on learning. We used a partial cross-over study and analyzed the data collected by two adaptive tutors on while loops and for loops over six semesters. We found that when students were unfamiliar with the concepts, they solved fewer problems and therefore, learned significantly less when they were provided more opportunities for revision with error-flagging feedback. But, once they became more familiar with the concepts, allowing for more revisions had no deleterious effect on learning."

       "abstract":"Advances in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the ever-growing scale of Interactive Educational Systems (IESs) have led to the rise of data-driven approaches for knowledge tracing and learning path recommendation. Unfortunately, collecting student interaction data is challenging and costly. As a result, there is no public large-scale benchmark dataset reflecting the wide variety of student behaviors observed in modern IESs. Although several datasets, such as ASSISTments, Junyi Academy, Synthetic and STATICS are publicly available and widely used, they are not large enough to leverage the full potential of state-of-the-art data-driven models. Furthermore, the recorded behavior is limited to question-solving activities. To this end, we introduce EdNet, a large-scale hierarchical dataset of diverse student activities collected by Santa, a multi-platform self-study solution equipped with an artificial intelligence tutoring system. EdNet contains 131,417,236 interactions from 784,309 students collected over more than 2 years, making it the largest public IES dataset released to date. Unlike existing datasets, EdNet records a wide variety of student actions ranging from question-solving to lecture consumption to item purchasing. Also, EdNet has a hierarchical structure which divides the student actions  into 4 different levels of abstractions. The features of EdNet are domain-agnostic, allowing EdNet to be easily extended to different domains. The dataset is publicly released for research purposes. We plan to host challenges in multiple AIEd tasks with EdNet to provide a common ground for the fair comparison between different state-of-the-art models and to encourage the development of practical and effective methods."

       "title":"Learning Outcomes and their Relatedness under Curriculum Drift",
       "abstract":"A typical medical curriculum is organized as a hierarchy of Learning Outcomes (LOs), each LO describes a concept to be mastered. Machine learning models have been successfully applied for LO-relationship extraction, the task of predicting related-ness between LOs. These models are trained on ground truth (examples of LO-relationships) collected through annotations from medical experts. However, medical curricula are periodically reviewed and revised. Resulting changes are both organizational (changes to placement and grouping of LOs within the curriculum), and semantic (changes to content or level of detail in an LO). Re-obtaining expert annotations for the revised curriculum is both costly and time-consuming, therefore a model that hopes to scale the LO-relationship extraction task must adapt to changes in the curriculum. \nThis work addresses the problem of model adaptation under curriculum drift, in two steps - First, we propose heuristics that leverage ground-truth available for the old curriculum to generate reliable annotations for the revised curriculum. Second, starting with a model pre-trained on the old curriculum, we inject a task-specific transformation layer to capture nuances of the revised curriculum. We experimentally evaluate our approach and show significant performance gains on a held-out test set, thus making progress towards an adaptive, scalable LO-relationship extraction system."

       "abstract":"Early literacy and numeracy skills are developed during childhood at kindergarten level. Among the many factors that influence the development of such skills, the literature shows that the executive function of inhibition -- i.e. the blocking out or tuning out of information or action that is irrelevant to the learning task -- is one of the most important. There are many tests to assess children's inhibition skills; however, such tests are generally time-consuming and have a short lifespan. In this context, we propose a computational approach to model children's inhibition skills by using only student traces from a learning app as input. Specifically, we propose a mathematical formalization of three related inhibition features, which we use as input to four classification algorithms. Our results show that by using the proposed features, we are able to enhance the classification performance of all algorithms, achieving an improvement up to 56.9% in Precision and up to 74.4% in AUC ROC for the Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier compared to our baseline."

Despite recognising the importance of trans-parency and understanding of the models, little effort has been made to in-vestigate the errors made by these models. In this paper, we address this gap by analysing large errors of classifying students at-risk of not submitting their assignments, when the model was confident about a student outcome, yet the result was different. We analysed two groups: students predicted to submit their assignment, yet they did not (False Negative) and students predicted not to submit yet they did (False Positive). We conducted mixed-method analysis, combining quantitative analysis of predictions of more than 25,000 students with follow-up qualitative online interviews with 12 of them. The quantitative analysis revealed that the most prevalent factor in False Positives was immediate growth of student activity after the predic-tions were generated. Interviews revealed that amongst those students most of them were retaking the course for a second or third time.In False Nega-tives, non-submission of assignments was explained by personal, financial and practical reasons. Overall, the factors explaining the different outcome were not related to any of the student data currently captured by the model. Implications of this work are discussed."

       "abstract":"As an important technique for modeling the knowledge states of learners, the traditional knowledge tracing (KT) models have been widely used to support intelligent tutoring systems and MOOC platforms. Driven by the fast advancements of deep learning techniques, deep neural network has been recently adopted to design new KT models for achieving better prediction performance. However, the lack of interpretability of these models has painfully impeded their practical applications, as their outputs and working mechanisms suffer from the intransparent decision process and complex inner structures. We thus propose to adopt the post-hoc method to tackle the interpretability issue for deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models. Specifically, we focus on applying the layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) method to interpret RNN-based DLKT model by backpropagating the relevance from the model's output layer to its input layer. The experiment results show the feasibility using the LRP method for interpreting the DLKT model's predictions, and partially validate the computed relevance scores from both question level and concept level. We believe it can be a solid step towards fully interpreting the DLKT models and promote their practical applications in the education domain."

The first part of the study analyzes the aspects at two weeks between a test group and a control group.

Our aim is to create a reliable automated representation to estimate readers’ level of comprehension based on different productions, namely self-explanations and answers to open-ended questions. Previous work relied on Cohesion Network Analysis to model a cohesion graph composed of semantic links between multiple reference texts and student productions. From this graph, a set of features was derived and used to build machine learning models to predict student comprehension scores. In this paper, we build on top of the previous study by: a) extending the CNA graph by adding new semantic links targeting specific sentences that should have been captured within the learner’s productions, b) cleaning the self-explanations by eliminating frozen expression, as well as entries which seemed nearly identical to the source text, c) introducing an additional classification into high/low performance students to provide insights on meaningful predictors. The results are in line with the conclusions of the previous study regarding the importance of both self-explanations and question answers in predicting the students’ reading comprehension level.

       "abstract":"Despite a long-standing interest in the within-group role of socio-cognitive conflict on learning, the between-group effects of conflict on learning remain poorly understood - how do between-group environments shape the learning effects of within-group socio-cognitive conflict? Gamification, the application of game elements to non-game settings, is a funny and attractive between-group condition which could affect socio-cognitive conflict reaction in within-group. Drawing on social interdependence theory, we hypothesized that group members use between-group gamification information to enlighten their learning activities in within-group conflict, but only when the social learning or competition strategy is adopted as the gamification design. The learning effectiveness of socio-cognitive conflict in different gamification context is tested experimentally. In a 4×3 mixed-design experiment with academic performances as the dependent variable, socio-cognitive conflict induced by contradictory information (True-False, False-True, False-False, True-True) is a within-subjects factor and gamification design varied in types (social learning strategy, competition strategy, no gamification) is a between-subjects factor. Our results found that the positive learning effects of socio-cognitive conflict in within-group were strengthened when the between-group gamification is designed by social learning or competitive strategy. Moreover, social learning gamification and competition strategy gamification produce different effects on the learning effects of within-group socio-cognitive conflict when dealing with different conflicts. This suggests that we should make conscious choices when applying certain gamification mechanics to an education setting."

However, many agent systems are not developed with the ability to understand non-verbal input. However, being able to automatically parse such input is essential for the practice of interpersonal skills such as empathy. Currently, it is still an open question which prosodic or visual features would aid automatic classification of empathy and how this knowledge can be used to support the practice of these skills. As a first step towards this goal, we report on 42 second-year nursing students practicing their empathy skills with a virtual patient or through collaborative role playing. Specifically, we investigate how a virtual patient could train empathy skills towards dementia patients and when it may be most effective in the training process. We found that across both the role playing and simulation, students assessed their empathy as increasing over time but higher during the role playing. Through a reflective survey on the learning experience, we identified five design suggestions for the use of virtual patients. Our work contributes to the continued development of virtual agents for the training of interpersonal skills."

The fast development of deep learning methods in recent years has prompted researchers to apply recurrent neural networks (RNN) to intelligent tutoring and computer-supported learning domains. As a result, deep learning models have shown performance superior to traditional models like BKT. RNNs, however, are less efficient when applied to long sequences of time-series data with extended patterns that are typical for learning systems. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based model to trace students' knowledge. We modified the Transformer structure to account for 1) the structure of the problem and 2) the elapsed time between problem steps. The use of problem structures allows the model to leverage between-problem relations. The inclusion of elapsed time opens the opportunity to address forgetting. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the literature by roughly 10\\% in AUC with frequently used public datasets."

Curricular standards in STEM (NGSS) and computer science have emphasized the role of asking questions to support learning and inquiry in K-12 education. The increasingly complex technological ecosystems of today’s classrooms require a new understanding of how students approach problems, especially in a collaborative context. Naturally occurring learner-to-learner questions provide rich insight into student’s learning processes as they explore and construct the necessary knowledge.

Individual student performance was peer-assessed through the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) tool, and team performance was assessed through grades for work products (a team paper and presentation) and evaluations by upperclass student team leaders. Using the transcript from the first class (5000+ messages) as input, we used machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes and neural networks), informed by Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and prior hand-labeling, to predict both individual and team performance, with encouraging success. We then trained a machine learning model to automatically replicate the hand-labels earlier shown to be helpful in predicting team performance, but for the 6000+ message transcript from the second class. In turn, we used these predicted labels, in conjunction with other psycholinguistic features from LIWC and text embedding features (e.g., Doc2Vec) to predict both individual and team performance in this second class.

However, few tools are available for augmenting emotional clarity that represents the extent to which these multicultural learners understand the origins of their own emotions, which is essential for being able to take direct action changing the circumstances or thoughts that result in those emotions. In this paper, we present a field study conducted in real language classrooms. We developed machine learning models based on wearable skin conductance sensors to predict non-verbal behaviors for exploring how anxiety can be indicated among ELLs. This provides us categories of anxiety: both PSA and FLA, predominantly PSA or FLA, and no anxiety. The ELLs were labeled with these anxiety categories based on the non-verbal behaviors exhibited in the presentation. To classify the ELLs into their respective anxiety categories, we extracted multiple electrodermal activity (EDA) signal features and found prominent EDA features supporting the predictions of anxiety sources. These results may encourage both ELLs and instructors to be aware of the origins of anxiety subtypes and develop a customized practice for public speaking in a foreign language."

While there are opportunities to create automated systems to help instructors personalize their interventions, much care must be taken to prevent the introduction of unintended outcomes. This paper aims to derive a more nuanced under-standing of personalization before implementing an automated personalization system. In this study, we designed a weekly personalized intervention cycle based on students’ self-reports. The effect of such personalized intervention was then evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA. Findings suggest that students receiving personalized interventions were more time efficient in makerspaces and on assignments. Additionally, they reported a lower level of frustration. Students with personalized intervention, however, expressed a lower sense of community. This suggests that while additional data provided to instructors can support personalized assistance, a more nuanced approach may be needed to avoid unintended consequences.

       "abstract":"Game-based learning environments hold significant potential for supporting K-12 computer science (CS) education by providing CS learning experiences within engaging virtual worlds. Typically, game-based learning environments are organized around a set of levels, often designed to target specific learning objectives. However, many game-based learning environments present students with a fixed set of levels that do not adaptively support individual students based on their specific knowledge and skills. This is often due to the fact that creating levels is highly labor-intensive for game developers, which limits the total number of game levels created for students. Procedural content generation (PCG) is a promising direction for addressing this challenge by dynamically generating game levels that address specific student needs without requiring extensive development time. In this paper, we investigate a PCG framework that is driven by answer set programming (ASP), a variant of deductive logic programming, which utilizes well-formed logical rules to represent constraints for valid game levels. We demonstrate how variations in CS learning objectives and gameplay skills can be incorporated into ASP-based rules to generate levels for a game-based learning environment designed to support CS learning in middle-grade students. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the PCG-created levels suggest that the ASP-based level generator not only generates desired CS educational game levels in a reliable manner but that it also synthesizes a very large set of game levels. These results suggest that the approach has considerable promise for supporting highly engaging and adaptive game-based learning experiences for K-12 CS education."

Firstly, we propose a machine learning approach to generate personalized feedback in an automated way, which takes individual needs of students into account, while alleviating the need of expert intervention and design of hand-crafted rules. We utilize state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing techniques to provide the students with personalized feedback along three different dimensions: personalized hints and explanations, Wikipedia-based explanations, and mathematical hints. Secondly, we demonstrate that the personalized feedback leads to improved learning gains in practice: our personalized feedback model is used in Anonymized, a large-scale dialogue-based ITS with over 5,000 students launched in 2019. We present the results of experiments with students and show that the automated, data-driven, personalized feedback leads to considerable improvement in student learning outcomes and in the subjective evaluation of the feedback."

Some technologies (such as Cognitive Tutor) utilize data-driven model-based algorithms such as Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT) for mastery learning, while others (such as Khan Academy, ASSISTments, and ALEKS) use simple heuristics to assess mastery. Heuristics have the advantage of being easy to express and understand, and prior work has suggested that heuristics may often perform comparably to model-based algorithms. But is there any reason we should expect these heuristics to be reasonable? In this paper, we show that some mastery learning heuristics can be reinterpreted as model-based algorithms. For example, we show that the N-Consecutive Correct in a Row (N-CCR) heuristic is actually the optimal mastery learning policy for a BKT model with zero probability of slipping. Similarly, we show that a simplified version of ALEKS' learning sequence is the optimal policy for a BKT model where we make no assumptions about how likely a student is to learn at any given time step. By putting mastery learning heuristics on the same playing field as model-based algorithms, we can gain insights on their hidden assumptions about learning, why they might perform well in practice, and how to tune their parameters with data."

A sample of 228 near-graduation Information Science students from one research-intensive tertiary institution in West African participated in this study. The course instructor manually rated short answers provided by the participants, using a scoring rubric and awarded scores ranging from 0 to 5. Some of the manually graded students' answers were randomly selected and used as a training set to fine-tune the neural network language model. Then quadratic-weighted kappa (QWKappa) was used to test the agreement level between the ratings generated by the human rater compared with that of the language model, on three variations of questions, including description, comparison and listing. Further, the accuracy of this model was tested on the same questions. Overall results showed that the level of the inter-rater agreement was good on the three variety of questions. Also, the accuracy measures showed that the model performed very well on the comparison and description questions compared to the listing question.  \n"

        "abstract":"Personalized recommendation as a practical approach to overcoming information overloading has been widely used in e-learning. Based on learners individual knowledge level, we propose a new model that can predict learners needs for recommendation using dynamic graph-based knowledge tracing. By applying the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the Attention model, this approach designs a dynamic graph over different time steps. Through learning feature information and topology representation of nodes/learners, this model can predict with high accuracy of 80,63% learners with low knowledge acquisition and prepare them for further recommendation."

        "title":"Exploring Automatic Short Answer Grading as a Tool to Assist in Human Rating",
        "abstract":"This project proposes using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) as a tool to assist educators with automated short answer grading (ASAG) as opposed to replacing human judgement in high-stakes scenarios. Many educators are hesitant to give authority to an automated system, especially in assessment tasks such as grading constructed response items. However, evaluating free-response text can be time and labor costly for one rater, let alone multiple raters. In addition, some degree of inconsistency exists within and between raters for assessing a given task. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing have resulted in subsequent improvements for technologies that rely on artificial intelligence and human language. New, state-of-the-art models such as BERT, an open source, pre-trained language model, have decreased the amount of training data needed for specific tasks and in turn, have reduced the amount of human annotation necessary for producing a high-quality classification model. After training BERT on expert ratings of constructed responses, we use subsequent automated grading to calculate Cohen’s Kappa as a measure of inter-rater reliability between the automated system and the human rater. For practical application, when the inter-rater reliability metric is unsatisfactory, we suggest that the human rater(s) use the automated model to call attention to ratings where a second opinion might be needed to confirm the rater’s correctness and consistency of judgement."

        "abstract":"This study attempts to use a deep neural network to assess the acquisition of knowledge and skills by students. This module is intended to shape a personalized learning path through the e-learning system. Assessing student progress at each stage of learning in an individualized process is extremely tedious and arduous. The only solution is to automate assessment using Deep Learning methods. The obstacle is the relatively small amount of data, in the form of available assessments, which is needed to train the neural network. The specifity of each subject/course taught requires the preparation of a separate neural network. The paper proposes a new method of data augmentation, Asynchronous Data Augmentation through Pre-Categorization (ADAPC), which solves this problem. It has been shown that it is possible to train a very effective deep neural network with the proposed method even for a small amount of data."

        "abstract":"There is increasing interest in the conceptualization of Self-Regulated learning (SRL) as a dynamic process which unfolds over the course of a learning activity. This is partly because this conceptualization could potentially be operationalized and used as the basis for AI and analytics tools which monitor and scaffold SRL in real-time. However, while there is an abundance of research on theories of SRL, little research explicitly reviews and operationalizes such theoretical considerations. Work is needed to develop frameworks for the practical applications of fundamental SRL theories, helping researchers move from conceptual considerations to operationalization in real world settings. In this paper, we propose a theoretically grounded framework for investigating SRL in the context of online tutoring for upper primary school learners. SRL is interpreted as a social learning construct, and the framework proposed is designed to investigate the influence of tutor practices on the development of learners’ SRL. We present the results of a pilot study that explored the applicability of the framework."

The article discusses the results of an experiment aimed at answering the following question: are eye tracking based measures related to the intrinsic cognitive load (ICL) connected with program comprehension? Thirty one students of computer science took part in the experiment. They analyzed two program codes written in the C++ language to search for (1) logical errors (LER) and (2) syntax errors (SER). ICL was measured by subjective rating of the difficulty of each task. There were significant differences found for the subjective measures of intrinsic load, the effectiveness and the time of tasks performance, and the values of eye tracking parameters: fixation duration average (FDA) and saccade amplitude average (SAA) in two experiment conditions. Longer fixation and shorter saccades were associated with higher ICL. The results obtained suggest that FDA and SAA are eye tracking measures sensitive of intrinsic cognitive load."

One important factor in that complex process regards the cohesion of the document(s). Here, we tackle the challenge of providing researchers and practitioners with a tool to visualize text cohesion both within (intra) and between (inter) texts. This tool, Multi-document Cohesion Network Analysis (MD-CNA), expands the structure of a CNA graph with lexical overlap links of multiple types, together with coreference links to highlight dependencies between text fragments of different granularities. We introduce two visualizations of the CNA graph that support the visual exploration of intratextual and intertextual links. First, a hierarchical view displays a tree-structure of discourse as a visual illustration of CNA links within a document. Second, a grid view available at paragraph or sentence levels displays links both within and between documents, thus ensuring ease of visualization for links spanning across multiple documents. Two use cases are provided to evaluate key functionalities and insights for each type of visualization."

In the context of Intelligent Tutoring Systems, modelling the forgetting curve for each user and knowledge component (e.g. vocabulary word) should enable us to develop optimal revision strategies that counteract memory decay and ensure long-term retention. In this study we explore a variety of forgetting curve models incorporating psychological and linguistic features, and we use these models to predict the probability of word recall by learners of English as a second language. We evaluate the impact of the models and their features using data from an online vocabulary teaching platform and find that word complexity is a highly informative feature which may be successfully learned by a neural network model."

The analysis of discussion posts from Stanford University dataset affirms the effectiveness of our model. BERT achieve good classification accuracy; this will help in early drop out detection and also facilitate future support for learners in confusion state."

There is an expanding body of research which investigates connections between these features and success in mathematics. This study used principle component analysis to identify four components related to motivational constructs. These components were examined using correlations with mathematics performance at three difficulty levels. Data from 572 students were examined, with results indicating little to no links between human judgments of motivational constructs and math performance. These findings have implications for how motivational constructs in math are evaluated and how they can predict mathematics performance."

        "abstract":"If AI systems are to be used for truly human decision-making in education, teachers will need better support for deciding upon educational interventions and strategies on an ethically informed basis. As indicated by a recent call by the AIED Society to focus on the FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) of AI in education, fundamental issues in this area remain to be explicated, and teachers’ perspectives need to be accounted for. The paper offers examples of how AI may serve to promote learning but at the cost of presenting limited or untruthful information to the student. For example, false information about a student’s current progress may motivate students to finish a task they would otherwise give up; hiding information from the student that is disclosed to the teacher may decrease students’ cognitive load while supporting the teacher’s strategic choices, and deceiving the student as to the actual nature of the task or interaction, such as when using virtual agents, can increase students’ efforts towards learning. Potential conflicts between such scenarios and basic values of FATE are discussed, and the basis for developing an “augmented ethics” system to support teachers’ decision-making is presented."

Further, evaluation of these explanations can yield important information about students’ cognition.

College students (N = 75) produced self-explanations during reading and explanatory retrievals after reading. The Constructed Response Assessment Tool (CRAT) was used to analyze these responses across multiple dimensions of language and relate these textual features to comprehension performance. Results indicate that the linguistic features of post-reading explanatory retrievals were more predictive of comprehension outcomes than self-explanations. Further, these models relied on different indices to predict performance."
