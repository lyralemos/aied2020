                        <h2>Neil Heffernan </h2>
                        <p>
                            Since 2002 <a href="https://www.neilheffernan.net/" target="blank">Neil Heffernan</a> has been a Professor at Worcester Polytechnic 
                            Institute in the Computer Science Department. 
                            He taught middle school math and science in the Teach for America program in Baltimore where he met his soon to be spouse, Cristina. 
                            When he got into CMU's PhD program in computer science he knew he would be building educational technology to help school teachers. 
                            Cristina and Neil created the ASSISTments, a platform used by 50,000 across the United States for daily classwork and nightly homework. 
                            In 1997 he had a seizure and was told he had brain cancer and only had 2-3 years to live; this helped motivate giving away this 
                            platform as a free public service. In October of 2016 an objective independent research organization, SRI International, 
                            <a href="http://www.aboutus.assistments.org/homework-immediate-feedback---1-year-study.php" target="_blank">published a peer-review journal article</a> 
                            reporting that ASSISTments caused students to learn 75% more on a standardized test of math achievement, 
                            compared to what they would have learned in a typical school year. In December of 2016 Cristina and Neil were invited to present at the 
                            White House on ASSISTments.  Neil and Cristina now are funding by NSF and Schmidt Future to let other researchers use his platform and 
                            student to run their own studies. Neil has written 80+ papers on learner analytics (using data to predict some outcome in education) 
                            and over two dozen papers reporting the results on randomized controlled trials.

                        <h3>"How Can Platforms Like ASSISTments Be Used to Improve Research?" </h3>

                        <p>
                            The head of the Institute of Education Sciences 
                            <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/schneider-garg-medical-researchers-find-cures-by-conducting-many-studies-and-failing-fast-we-need-to-do-the-same-for-education/">is asking about how to use platform</a> 
                            to increase education sciences. 
                            <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/heffernan-how-can-we-know-if-ed-tech-works-by-encouraging-companies-researchers-to-share-data-government-funding-can-help/">We have been addressing this</a>.  
                            So how do you use platforms like EdX, Khan Academy, Canvas to improve science? There is a crisis in American 
                            Science referred to as the Reproducibility Crisis where many experimental results are not able to be reproduced. We are trying 
                            to address this crisis by helping “good science” to be done. People that control platforms have a responsibility to try to make 
                            them useful tools for learning what works. In Silicon Valley, every company is doing AB Testing to refine their individual products. 
                            That, in and of itself, is a good thing and we should use these platforms to figure out how to make them more effective. One 
                            of the ways we should do that is by experimenting with different ways of helping students succeed. 
                            <a href="http://www.assistments.org/">ASSISTments</a>, a platform I 
                            have created, with 50,000 middle-school math students, is used to help scientists run studies. I will explain how we have over 
                            100 experiments running inside the ASSISTments platform and how the ASSISTmentsTestBed.org allows external researchers to propose 
                            studies. I will also explain how proper oversight is done by our Institutional Review Board. Further, I will explain how users 
                            of this platform agree ahead of time to OpenScience procedures such as open-data, open-materials and pre-registration. I’ll 
                            illustrate some examples with the 
                            <a href="https://www.etrialstestbed.org/">twenty-four randomized controlled trials</a> that I have published as well as the three studies 
                            that have more recently come out from the platform by others. Finally, I will point to how we are anonymizing our data and how 
                            over 
                            <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/assistmentsstudies/useourdata">34 different external researchers have used our datasets to publish scientific studies</a>. I would like to thank the U.S. 
                            Department of Education and the National Science Foundation for their support of over $32 million from 40+ grants.

                        <p>
                            Yvonne Rogers is a Professor of Interaction Design, the director of UCLIC and a deputy head of the Computer Science department 
                            at University College London. Her research interests are in the areas of ubiquitous computing, interaction design and human-computer 
                            interaction. A central theme of her work is concerned with designing interactive technologies that augment humans. A current 
                            focus of her research is on human data interaction. She is also interested in what human-centered AI means in practice. Central 
                            to her work is a critical stance towards how visions, theories and frameworks shape the fields of HCI, cognitive science and 
                            Ubicomp. She has been instrumental in promulgating new theories (e.g., external cognition), alternative methodologies (e.g., in 
                            the wild studies) and far-reaching research agendas (e.g., 
                            <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/hci2020/">"Being Human: HCI in 2020"</a>). She has also published two monographs

                        <h3>"The New Zeitgeist: Human-AI"</h3>

                        <p>
                            In place of the Singularity, Superintelligence and General AI visions that have dominated much of the debate surrounding AI 
                            (that predicted that machines will become eventually become more intelligent than human beings and take over the world) quite 
                            different ways of imagining AI are now emerging that are less dystopian or utopian-driven. In contrast, a new discourse is 
                            emerging that is rethinking the benefits of future AI advances from a more human perspective. The main thrust of this approach 
                            is to orient towards envisioning new forms of human-AI partnerships, where humans collaborate with, talk to, or even confide in 
                            AI, and conversely, where AI, through its various guises, becomes a companion, therapist, colleague, assistant or other. 
                            Such a shift in thinking enables researchers and developers to design quite different kinds of intelligent systems - those 
                            that augment humans. The implications of doing so are profound; especially when considering how to enhance the way learners, 
                            educators and teachers can collaborate with AI in the future. In my talk I will begin to describe what the opportunities and 
                            challenges are with this new framing for AI and Ed.
