                        We are currently exploring virtual conference platforms so that we can deliver the best possible experience for 
                        everyone during these unprecedented times. It is important to us that we offer opportunities for interaction
                         between attendees and that we try to retain some of the spirit and energy of a physical conference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once we have chosen our conference platform we will be working with all presenters and moderators to ensure
                         everyone is comfortable with the technology and able to present their ideas with confidence. More information 
                         to follow when we know more.
