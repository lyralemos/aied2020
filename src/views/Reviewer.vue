                        We strongly recommend reading this excellent source on reviewing protocol:

                        As a reviewer, you have a vital responsibility: to fairly and constructively evaluate 
                        a submission that the authors dedicated substantial time and effort in creating. Your 
                        evaluation will help determine if the work will be published in the proceedings of 
                        AIED’20 and, regardless of the outcome, it will also provide feedback to the authors 
                        on how they can improve their work.

                        A good review hits a number of points: (1) it identifies the contribution of the work, 
                        (2) it states what was good in the paper, (2) it mentions weaknesses and, if these are 
                        deal breakers, makes clear why, and (3) it offers suggestions on how to improve the work, 
                        regardless if the proposed outcome is a reject or accept. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, a review cannot be just a few lines long. Simply stating “this is a great paper, 
                        it should be accepted because it makes a contribution” is not sufficient. Why is it a 
                        great paper? What contributions does it make? What feedback can you give the authors to 
                        improve the paper? Papers are rarely perfect (if ever!!) and so there are clarifications 
                        that can be made, claims that can be revised and so on  - but just because that is the 
                        case does not mean the paper should be rejected. Consider if the paper provides a 
                        contribution to the field of AIED,  one that we can all learn from– if so, become a 
                        champion for the paper by providing explicit suggestions to the authors on how to improve 
                        the paper. Offer constructive suggestions; include questions on aspects that were not clear 
                        and why they weren’t clear so the authors know what they need to revise. 
                    </p>

                        Likewise, stating that a paper should be rejected because it (has limited sample 
                        size/ it does not make a contribution / it should have used analysis X instead of 
                        Y/etc) is not sufficient – unpack the details. If another analysis method should have 
                        been used, make it clear why the results are not valid with the present one. If the 
                        sample size should have been bigger, consider if the paper could still offer a 
                        contribution because it presents a novel insight on some feature (e.g., instructional 
                        design). While papers that do not provide a contribution should not be accepted, 
                        do not set out to reject a paper.

                        When writing a review, keep a number of questions in mind: (1) what was the goal 
                        of the work? (2) was it well motivated / does the literature review make a gap 
                        clear that needs to be filled? (3) does the work address the research goals? (4) 
                        are the analyses used appropriate and valid? (4) are the conclusions valid? 
                    </p>

                        If they are not key resources missing, please avoid self-promotion through suggestions 
                        of your own papers to be cited.
