                        Registration for AIED 2020 is now live. We are currently only offering conference registration, 
                        as we are still developing our workshop offers for this year. You will be able to buy workshop 
                        attendance separately from your conference registration, so please check back here in a few 
                        weeks for workshop options.
                    </p>
