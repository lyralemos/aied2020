                    <p>The AIED Doctoral Consortium is an interactive workshop to support PhD candidate scholars working in domains relevant to the interdisciplinary research areas of AIED. In the workshop, doctoral students will share and discuss their research ideas and plans with more experienced colleagues, i.e. mentors, who will provide feedback on various aspects of student’s work including the theoretical framing and the methodological approaches. Doctoral Consortium participants will also have the opportunity to informally present their research to the larger AIED community.</p>

                    <p>We invite all doctoral students for submissions. However, the candidates selected will be those who are at a stage at which feedback from the AIED community will be of most value. That is, the doctoral candidates have a clear topic and research approach, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along in their work that they can no longer benefit from feedback received during the conference. Thus, the candidates should neither have completed their doctorate, nor officially submitted their thesis prior to the Doctoral Consortium. The papers must be primarily authored by the students but can have advisors and collaborators listed as co-authors. The topics of interest are related to the main conference topics.</p>

                    <p>Though the main objective of the doctoral consortium is to provide an opportunity for feedback on workshop attendees’ current research, we also seek to continue to build interdisciplinary research ideas, theoretical frameworks, and methodological approaches because these intersections are critical to AIED as an area of scholarship. We recognize that a supportive and transdisciplinary research community can only be possible with opportunities for healthy dialogic exchange between members of the AIED community. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the doctoral consortium fosters such collaborative interactions among the participants of the conference in order to enhance the experience of all participants and build capacity in the field.</p>

                    <h3>Format and Content</h3>
                    <p>Accepted candidates will participate in roundtable sessions during the conference where they will present their work and receive feedback from all the senior researchers and other doctoral participants in the session. In addition, each student with an accepted paper will be assigned a mentor with specialized background on the student’s research topic or methodological approach so a more detailed and specific feedback can be provided to each student.</p>
                    <p>The day will culminate in a social hour at which the doctoral participants will be able to informally present their revised research ideas to all members of the AIED community.</p>
                    <p>The submission to the session has two parts: 1) the paper (to be published in the conference proceedings), and 2) a presentation letter with additional information about the student and the research carried out to date.</p>
                    <p>The papers should describe (using the format explained below), in a logical and coherent manner, the aims and objectives of the proposed research, by clearly illustrating:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The problem(s) addressed and the fit with the state of the art, including any previous work the student has done.</li>
                        <li>The proposed solution(s) and the methodology adopted to achieve it, as well as the progress made to date.</li>
                        <li>The expected contribution(s) and impact of the research to the AIED community.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The presentation letter (no more than 2 pages) should include the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Title of the paper, Name of the student and Name of supervisor(s).</li>
                        <li>Title, University, and Short description of the study where the research is carried out.</li>
                        <li>A paragraph describing the stage of their studies, together with a brief description of their background.</li>
                        <li>The type of feedback sought from the doctoral candidate.</li>
                        <li>List of other contributions submitted to the AIED 2020 conference, including the list order of authors, and status of the submission.</li>
                        <li>Any other information that can be of interest to understand the motivation of the research carried out.</li>
                    </ol>
