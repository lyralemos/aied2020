                    <p>AIED 2019 workshops are designed to provide an opportunity for in-depth discussion of current and emerging topics of interest to the AIED community. We encourage workshop proposals that bring together people working on new and developing research topics that favor highly interactive discussions. Those proposing a workshop should provide information on why the workshop is of interest to the AIED community, and why a workshop on this topic is beneficial. Workshops that take into account the theme of AIED 2020 are especially encouraged: “Augmented Intelligence to Empower Education”.</p>
