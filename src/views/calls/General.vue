                        The 2020 conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education will take place in Ifrane (Morocco), between July 6 and 10.

                        The AIED 2020 conference theme will be “Augmented Intelligence to Empower Education”.  As AI in Education systems get 
                        more mature and are implemented at scale in real-world contexts, the value of using AI systems in the service of human 
                        decision making, rather than automated personalisation, becomes more apparent than ever. While this paradigm of augmented 
                        intelligence is not new to the field,solid theoretical and/or empirical work in the area is limited. Further work is needed 
                        to understand the balance of human and artificial aspects in intelligence systems that involve human and AI partnerships. 
                        Developing and implementing AI-human hybrid systems requires new research and many questions remain to be answered. In this 
                        conference, we invite the community to think about intelligence augmentation opportunities that would empower key stakeholders 
                        of education and provide innovative and creative solutions supported with empirical evidence.

                        AIED 2020 will be the 21th edition of a longstanding series of international conferences, formerly bi-annual and now annual, 
                        known for high quality research on intelligent systems and cognitive science approaches for educational computing applications. 
                        AIED 2020 solicits empirical and theoretical papers particularly (but not exclusively) in the following lines of research and 
                        application:

                    <p>
                        Full papers, short papers, and industry papers will be published by Springer Lecture Notes in 
                        Computer Science (LNCS). Submissions must be in Springer format. Papers that do not use the 
                        required format may be rejected without review. For further details about the format, please see  
                        <a href="https://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0" target="_blank">

                    <p>
                        For the main track, there are two categories of papers. Full papers should present integrative reviews 
                        or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development 
                        and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as talks. 
                        Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. 
                        The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and 
                        practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers  will be presented as posters.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All papers will be reviewed by the program committee to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. 
                        The review process will be double-blind review process, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will 
                        remain anonymous. To this end, authors should: (a) eliminate all information that could lead to their 
                        identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, 
                        projects and/or systems); (b) cite to your prior work (if needed) in the third person; and (c) eliminate 
                        acknowledgments and references to funding sources. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, 
                        technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is important to note that the work presented should not have been published previously or be under 
                        consideration in other conferences of journals. Any paper caught in double submission will be rejected 
                        without review.
                    </p>

                    <p>Maximum paper length is as follows:</p>
