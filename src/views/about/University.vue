                        Al Akhawayn University is a 10/15 minute walk from town. 
                        It is the most stunning campus university, with fabulous 
                        facilities and enviable architecture. Features include; a 
                        wonderful library, lecture theatres, a mosque and an olympic 
                        size swimming pool. (yes, this really is the AIED when we 
                        could all get fit!) Additionally, the university boasts the 
                        fastest free wifi in all of Morocco - so you’ll be connected 
                        the whole time.

                        It is at the university that AIED 2020 will take place.

                        The nearest airport is Fez and I strongly suggest finding a connecting 
                        flight from wherever you are coming from, that will take you to Fez as 
                        this will be considerably easier than making your way overland through 
                        Morocco. Websites such as SkyScanner and Opodo could help you out (you 
                        can get a return to Fez from New York for $850) it’s also worth bearing 
                        in mind that flying via France may be your easiest alternative. There 
                        are more flights to Fez from French airports, as this is a popular 
                        vacation destination, due to Morocco being a French speaking country. 
                        Even those traveling from the UK, may have to change planes. RyanAir 
                        offers flights to Fez, but not daily.

                        It takes an hour by car from Fez Airport to Ifrane. Nearer the time we 
                        will find a way to coordinate arrivals in order to share lifts or 
                        minibuses. Drivers should note that car hire is a super simple option 
                        (I drove when I was there) and it really is just one road all the way 
                        from the airport to the university, so you can’t get lost. I should 
                        add that the rules of the road are not applied with the same rigour 
                        you may be used to, so it is worth making sure you have full insurance 
                        on your car! Once in town there’s plenty of free, roadside parking.
                        Once in Ifrane, pretty much everything is in walking distance. But 
                        there is a taxi rank right outside the university campus to take you 
                        anywhere you need to go.
