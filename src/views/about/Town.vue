                        On behalf of the AIED community, I have recently visited Ifrane, 
                        so as to be able to share my experience with you and hopefully, 
                        make planning your own trip to join us for AIED 2020 easier.

                        Ifrane, in the middle of the Atlas Mountains is beautiful. Certainly 
                        a surprising place to visit, as the atmosphere is more reminiscent 
                        of Switzerland than of North Africa. The town is pretty and feels 
                        very safe. Those of you who may have visited cities in Morocco, 
                        where as a tourist one can experience feeling hassled, or 
                        culturally out of your depth, need not worry in Ifrane. It’s a 
                        sleepy, relaxed place with a small population, not much traffic 
                        and breathtaking views.

                        The centre of town has very few shops and a few hotels and 
                        restaurants. It’s small and would be hard to get lost.
