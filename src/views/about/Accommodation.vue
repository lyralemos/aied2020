                        We will be offering campus accommodation when registration opens. 
                        This is a very pleasant and affordable option (roughly €35 per night). 
                        While I was there, I stayed in university accommodation and found it 
                        to be spacious and comfortable. To exemplify this, our special guests 
                        and speakers will be staying in university accommodation. However, those 
                        seeking more luxury alternatives, you will find plenty of hotel options 
                        in Ifrane, including the five star Michilfin just a few minutes walk away.

                        Just a few miles from the university, there is the university conference 
                        centre, which offer more luxury accommodation than available on campus - 
                        with this option, you must also consider transit to the campus each day. 
                        (Average cost of rooms here is €55 per night)

                        Those wishing to make a vacation out of their time in Morocco will find 
                        there is plenty for families to do while you’re attending the conference. 
                        It would be a shame to go all that way and not try to do a little sight 
                        seeing. The medieval city of Fez should not be missed!
