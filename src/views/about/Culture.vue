                        Morocco is a Muslim country, with liberal views. However it is worth 
                        noting that the campus and conference centre do not allow alcohol. 
                        At the conference there will be a great choice of cuisine, both local 
                        and international and there are some great restaurants in town including 
                        a sushi place and a pizzeria.
