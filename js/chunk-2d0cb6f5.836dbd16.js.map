Websites such as SkyScanner and Opodo could help you out (you can get a return to Fez from New York for $850) it’s also worth bearing in mind that flying via France may be your easiest alternative. There are more flights to Fez from French airports, as this is a popular vacation destination, due to Morocco being a French speaking country. Even those traveling from the UK, may have to change planes. RyanAir offers flights to Fez, but not daily. \")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" It takes an hour by car from Fez Airport to Ifrane. Nearer the time we will find a way to coordinate arrivals in order to share lifts or minibuses. Drivers should note that car hire is a super simple option (I drove when I was there) and it really is just one road all the way from the airport to the university, so you can’t get lost. I should add that the rules of the road are not applied with the same rigour you may be used to, so it is worth making sure you have full insurance on your car! Once in town there’s plenty of free, roadside parking. Once in Ifrane, pretty much everything is in walking distance.
