However, it has been shown that the availability of a simulator alone is not sufficient to promote practice. Therefore, simulator-based surgical curricula need to be developed and integrated into existing surgical training programs. As practice variation is an important aspect of a surgical curriculum, surgical simulators should support practice on multiple specimens. Furthermore, to ensure that surgical skills are acquired, and to support self-guided learning, automated feedback on performance needs to be provided during practice. Automated feedback is typically provided by comparing real-time performance with expert models generated from pre-collected data. Since collecting data on multiple specimens for the purpose of developing feedback models is costly and time-consuming, methods of transferring feedback from one specimen to another should be investigated. In this paper, we discuss a simple method of feedback transfer between specimens in virtual reality temporal bone surgery and validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the transfer through a user study."},{authors:"Sébastien Lallé and Cristina Conati.

In this paper, we show how FUMA, an existing data-driven framework for student modeling and adaptation, can help understand how to provide personalized support to MOOCs students, specifically targeting video watching behaviors. FUMA leverages genetic clustering and association rules mining to build interpretable models of student interaction with an educational tool. Here we show how FUMA can: (i) discover video watching behaviors that can be detrimental for or conductive to learning with a specific MOOC; (ii) leverage these behaviors to build classifiers that detect ineffective learners at different weeks of MOOCS usage. We tested the student models discovered by FUMA across different MOOCs to study how well these models may generalize. Furthermore, we discuss how these behaviors can be used to drive interventions that provide personalized support to effective MOOCs video usage."},{authors:"Masaki Uto and Masashi Okano. ",title:"Robust Neural Automated Essay Scoring using Item Response Theory",abstract:"Automated essay scoring (AES) is the task of automatically assigning scores to essays as an alternative to human grading. Conventional AES methods typically rely on manually tuned features, which are laborious to effectively develop. To obviate the need for feature engineering, many deep neural network (DNN)-based AES models have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. DNN-AES models require training on a large dataset of graded essays. Essay grading tasks are generally shared among many raters, assigning a few raters to each essay to lower assessment burdens. However, assigned scores are known to be strongly biased due to the effects of rater characteristics. Performance of DNN models rapidly drops when such biased data are used for model training. In the fields of educational and psychological measurement, item response theory (IRT) models that can estimate essay scores while considering effects of rater characteristics have recently been proposed. This study therefore proposes a new DNN-AES framework that integrates IRT models to deal with rater bias within training data. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt at addressing rating bias effects in training data, which is a crucial but overlooked problem."},{authors:"Anna Filighera, Tim Steuer and Christoph Rensing.

Artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce their burden by using automated agents to address the routine part of this teacher-student interaction, which will free up teachers to focus on more important aspects of learning. In this paper, we explore the use of automated question answering methods to power virtual teaching assistants in online course discussion forums. First, we focus on answering frequent and repetitive logistical questions and adopt a question answering framework that consists of two steps: retrieving relevant documents from a repository and extracting answers from the retrieved document. The document repository consists of course materials that contain information on course logistics, e.g., the syllabus, lecture slides, course emails, and prior discussion forum posts. This question answering framework can help virtual teaching assistants to decide whether a question is answerable and how to answer it. Second, we analyze the timing of student posts in discussion forums and develop a classifier that can predict the timing of follow-up posts in a discussion thread. This classifier can help virtual teaching assistants to decide whether to respond to a question and when to do so.

However, a common issue in mastery learning is that persistence is not always productive, which is defined as wheel-spinning. In this paper, we extend the prior work of wheel-spinning detectors in the ASSISTments learning system. More specifically, we investigate the predictive features and construct decision tree models to distinguish among the different types of non-persistence and persistence, including productive persistence and wheel-spinning. We also conduct pairwise comparisons between each of the two states. To explore the timing of such detection of each state, we compare model performances across student-problem set pairs with data from varying numbers of problem attempts. Based on the feature selection results, we identified the most common features selected to involve hint requests, the correctness of prior attempts, and the amount of practice and time on the skill. Furthermore, by evaluating the model performances for multiple class predictions, we identify the model constructed using data from the first nine problem attempts to outperform all other models including fewer attempt data. Pairwise comparisons of model performances show that it was sufficient to use data from the first three attempts to predict wheel-spinning against productive persistence, the first five attempts to predict wheel-spinning against non-persistence, and the first seven attempts to predict non-persistence against productive persistence. This study provides opportunities for early detection in intelligent tutoring systems.

In this paper, we study the usage data from 258 students who used a gamified learning environment as a part of their mathematics class. By simulating different adaptation techniques, we show that the learner model chosen to tailor gamification has significant effects on learners' motivation and engaged behaviours depending on the profile(s) used.

On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual student submissions, MACER outperforms all existing methods by 20% at suggesting fixes for common errors. MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types -- whether common or rare.

Feedback in the ELAi app was presented across multiple pages such that users could choose how much and the depth of feedback that they wanted to receive. The present work evaluates how 94 English language learners interacted with the app. We focused on participants’ use of the feedback pages and whether or not quality of users’ spontaneous speech improved over the course of using the app. The findings revealed that users were most likely to access the most superficial feedback page, but use of the feedback pages differed based on the total number of sessions that users completed with the app. Users showed improvement in their spontaneous speech over the course of using the app, which suggests that the design of repeated practice and adaptive, targeted feedback in the ELAi app was effective.

The influence of game performance on young students’ willingness to accept critical constructive feedback during play.",abstract:"In a learning situation, feedback is of great importance in order to help a student to correct a possible misconception. However, previous research shows that many students tend to avoid feedback regarding failures, including critical constructive feedback (CCF) that is intended to support and guide them. This is especially true for lower-achieving students, who might perceive feedback as an ego-threat, and therefore protect themselves by neglecting it. However, it has been shown that such neglect can be suppressed by using teachable agents (TA’s). Another, but less studied factor that influences feedback acceptance is the degree or extent of failure when trying to solve a task. The present study explores if and how momentary performance levels influence middle school students’ willingness to accept CCF when playing an educational game in history – with or without a TA. On the basis of teacher assessments of the students’ general skills, data logs and analyses of sequential patterns, we concluded that the willingness to accept CCF differs between students, but also between conditions and states. One major finding is that a TA supports the students to more readily embrace CCF, even if the effect is larger for lower-achieving students. Another finding is that indications of being far from succeeding, such as low success rates or repeated trials and revisions, have a negative impact on feedback acceptance, even if a TA mitigates some of this influence. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to meta-cognitive aspects of learning and to educational software design."},{authors:"Daniele Di Mitri, Jan Schneider, Kevin Trebing, Sasa Sopka, Marcus Specht and Hendrik Drachsler.

Multimodal affect detection combining sensor-based and sensor-free approaches has shown significant promise in both laboratory and classroom settings. However, important questions remain regarding which data channels are most predictive and how they should be combined. In this paper, we investigate a multimodal affect detection framework that integrates motion tracking-based posture data and interaction-based trace data to recognize the affective states of students engaged with a game-based learning environment for emergency medical training. We compare several machine learning-based affective models using competing feature-level and decision-level multimodal data fusion approaches. Results indicate that multimodal affect detectors induced using joint feature representations from posture-based and interaction-based data channels yield improved accuracy relative to unimodal models across several learner-centered affective states. These findings point toward implications for the design of multimodal affect-responsive learning environments that support learning and engagement."},{authors:"Jessica Mcbroom, Kalina Yacef and Irena Koprinska. ",title:"DETECT: A Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm for Trends in Periodic Educational Data",abstract:"Techniques for clustering student behaviour oﬀer many opportunities to improve educational outcomes by providing insight into student learning. However, one important aspect of student behaviour, namely its evolution over time, can often be challenging to identify using existing methods. This is because the objective functions used by these methods do not explicitly aim to ﬁnd cluster trends in time, so these trends may not be clearly represented in the results. This paper presents ‘DETECT’ (Detection of Educational Trends Elicited by Clustering Time-series data), a novel divisive hierarchical clustering algorithm that incorporates temporal information into its objective function to prioritise the detection of behavioural trends. The resulting clusters are similar in structure to a decision tree, with a hierarchy of clusters deﬁned by decision rules on features. DETECT is easy to apply, highly customisable, applicable to a wide range of educational datasets and yields easily interpretable results. Through a case study of two online programming courses (N > 600), this paper demonstrates two example applications of DETECT: 1) to identify how cohort behaviour develops over time and 2) to identify student behaviours that characterise exercises where many students give up."},{authors:"Ian Gliser, Caitlin Mills, Nigel Bosch, Shelby Smith, Daniel Smilek and Jeffery Wammes.

Previous work has investigated the influence of speech on attention, but has not been extended to live classroom lectures. In the current study, we automatically extracted acoustic features from live lectures to see how they related to rates of classroom mind-wandering (i.e., lack of student attention). Results indicated that five speech features reliably predicted classroom mind-wandering rates (Harmonic Noise Ratio, Formant 1 Mean, Formant 2 Mean, Formant 3 Mean, and Jitter Standard Deviation). These speaker correlates of mind-wandering may be a foundation for developing a system to provide feedback in real-time for the lecturers online and in the classroom. Such a system may prove to be highly beneficial in developing real-time tools to retain student attention, as well as informing other applications outside of the classroom."},{authors:"Kenneth Holstein, Vincent Aleven and Nikol Rummel.

In practice, beyond being a property of AIEd systems alone, adaptivity is often jointly enacted by AI systems and human facilitators (e.g., teachers, peer tutors, or parents). Despite much recent research activity, theoretical and conceptual guidance for the design of such human–AI systems remains limited. In this paper we explore how adaptivity may be distributed across AIEd systems and the various human stakeholders who work with them. Based on a comparison of prior frameworks, which tend to examine adaptivity in AIEd systems or human coaches separately, we first synthesize a set of dimensions general enough to capture human–AI hybrid adaptivity. Using these dimensions, we then present a taxonomy for hybrid adaptivity in education, specifying four distinct ways for humans and AIEd systems to augment each other’s abilities. Through examples, we illustrate how this taxonomy can be used to organize prior work, envision new possibilities, and surface open questions for human–AI hybrid approaches in education."},{authors:"Ahmad Al-Doulat, Nasheen Nur, Alireza Karduni, Aileen Benedict, Erfan Al-Hossami, Mary Lou Maher, Wenwen Dou, Mohsen Dorodchi and Xi Niu.

We have worked closely with advisors and Deans in our development of an innovative temporal model of student data, various statistical and machine learning models of the data, and interactive user experiences with the data. We report on the design and evaluation of FIRST, Finding Interesting stoRies about STudents, that supports advisors in understanding the context of each student when making recommendations in an advising session. FIRST provides an interactive experience in which the advisor: selects relevant student features to be included in a temporal model, interacts with a visualization of unsupervised learning that present patterns of student behavior and their correlation with performance, and chooses to view automatically generated stories about individual students based on student data in the temporal model. We have developed a high fidelity prototype of FIRST using 10 years of student data in our College. As part of our iterative design process, we performed a focus group study with five advisors following their use of the prototype. Our focus group evaluation highlights the sensemaking value in the temporal model, the unsupervised clusters of the behavior of all students in a major, and the stories about individual students.\n"},{authors:"Ashvini Varatharaj, Anthony F.

",title:"Supporting Teacher Assessment in Chinese Language Learning Using Textual and Tonal Features",abstract:"Assessment in the context of foreign language learning can be difficult and time-consuming for instructors. Distinctive from other domains, language learning often requires teachers to assess each student's ability to speak the language, making this process even more time-consuming in large classrooms which are particularly common in post-secondary settings; considering that language instructors often assess students through assignments requiring recorded audio, a lack of tools to support such teachers makes providing individual feedback even more challenging. In this work, we seek to explore the development of tools to automatically assess audio responses within a college-level Chinese language-learning course. We build a model designed to grade student audio assignments with the purpose of incorporating such a model into tools focused on helping both teachers and students in real classrooms. Building upon our prior work which explored features extracted from audio, the goal of this work is to explore additional features derived from tone and speech recognition models to help assess students on two outcomes commonly observed in language learning classes: fluency and accuracy of speech. In addition to the exploration of features, this work explores the application of Siamese deep learning models for this assessment task. We find that models utilizing tonal features exhibit higher predictive performance of student fluency while text-based features derived from speech recognition models exhibit higher predictive performance of student accuracy of speech."},{authors:"Jaclyn Ocumpaugh, Ryan Baker, Shamya Karumbaiah, Scott Crossley and Matthew Labrum.

In this study, we explore the relationship between affective sequences that have been previously explored in the literature and the activities students may engage in when interacting with Reasoning Mind, a blended learning system for elementary mathematics. The strongest correlations are found for students who shift from engaged concentration to frustration, making fewer actions in the system.

Reflective thinking serves a critical role in inquiry-driven learning by encouraging students to think critically about their knowledge and experiences in order to foster deeper learning processes. Free-response reflection prompts can be embedded in game-based learning environments to encourage students to engage in reflection and externalize their reflection processes, but automatically assessing student reflection presents significant challenges. In this paper, we present a framework for automatically assessing students’ written reflection responses during inquiry-driven learning in ANONYMIZED, a game-based learning environment for middle school microbiology education. Leveraging data from a classroom study involving 153 middle school students, we compare the effectiveness of several computational representations of students’ natural language responses to reflection prompts—GloVe, ELMo, tf-idf, unigrams—across several machine learning-based regression techniques (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron) to assess the depth of student reflection responses. Results demonstrate that ELMo’s pre-trained deep contextualized word representations yield more accurate predictions of students’ written reflection depth than competing baseline techniques. These findings point toward the potential of leveraging automated assessment of student reflection to inform real-time adaptive support for inquiry-driven learning in game-based learning environments."},{authors:"Dan Carpenter, Andrew Emerson, Bradford Mott, Asmalina Saleh, Krista Glazewski, Cindy Hmelo-Silver and James Lester. ",title:"Detecting Off-Task Behavior from Student Dialogue in Game-Based Collaborative Learning",abstract:"Recent years have seen a growing interest in collaborative game-based learning environments that support group learning. These environments often present students with a shared objective and provide them with a means to communicate, which allows the students to share information, ask questions, construct explanations, and work together toward their shared goal. One challenge in collaborative learning is when students stray from productive discourse, which may affect learning outcomes. Adaptive learning environments that can detect this off-task behavior in real-time have the potential to enhance collaboration between students by redirecting the conversation back to more productive topics. This paper investigates the use of dialogue analysis to classify student conversational utterances as either off-task or on-task. Using classroom data collected from 13 groups of four students, we identified off-task messages in a chat log integrated into ANONYMIZED, a collaborative game-based learning environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of different word embeddings (i.e., Word2vec, ELMo, and BERT), as well as predictive models that capture varying amounts of contextual information from the chat log. Results indicate that predictive models that incorporate a short window of recent context and represent the sequential nature of the chat messages achieve higher predictive performance compared to models that do not leverage this information. These findings suggest that collaborative game-based learning environments that use word embeddings to model the recent messages in students’ conversations have significant potential for reliably identifying off-task behavior and could be used to guide students back on task."},{authors:"Andrew Emerson, Nathan Henderson, Jonathan Rowe, Wookhee Min, Seung Lee, James Minogue and James Lester.

A salient feature of science museums is their capacity to attract diverse visitor populations that range broadly in age, interest, prior knowledge, and socio-cultural background, which can significantly affect how visitors interact with museum exhibits. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework for predicting learner engagement with ANONYMIZED, a tabletop science exhibit for environmental sustainability. We utilize multi-channel data (e.g., eye tracking, facial expression, posture, interaction logs) captured from visitor interactions with a fully-instrumented version of ANONYMIZED to model visitor dwell time with the exhibit in a science museum. We demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach outperforms competitive baseline techniques.

While it is expected that students are given free rein to work on their projects, facilitators have to strike a difficult balance between micromanaging them and letting the community support itself. In this paper, we explore how Kinect sensors can continuously monitor students’ social interactions so that instructors can gain a more comprehensive view of the social dynamics of the space. We employ heatmaps to examine the diversity of student social interactions and Markov transition probabilities to explore the transitions between types of social interactions. Findings indicate that letting students work on their own promotes the development of technical skills, while working together encourages students to spend more time in the makerspace. This confirms the intuition that successful projects in makerspaces necessitates both individual and group efforts. Furthermore, such aggregation and display of information can aid instructors in uncovering the state of student learning in makerspaces. Identifying the type and diversity of social interactions affords instructors an early opportunity to identify struggling students and having this data in a near real-time manner opens new doors in terms of making (un)productive behaviors salient, both for teachers and students. We discuss how this work represents a first step toward using intelligent systems to support student learning in makerspaces."},{authors:"Kamilla Tenório, Diego Dermeval, Mateus Monteiro, Aristoteles Peixoto and Alan Pedro.

Therefore, in order to avoid possible negative outcomes, this article is proposed the “gamification analytics model for teachers”. In this model, the teacher is allowed to define interaction goals, monitor students' interaction with the system’ learning resources and the gamification elements and adapt the gamification design through missions to engage and motivate students that are not achieving the interaction goals defined. However, the gamification analytics model-based design concepts that will be implemented in future gamified adaptive learning systems should be well-planned to respect the teachers’ needs. Consequently, the second contribution of this article is the validation of 20 design concepts based on the gamification analytics model for teachers through the speed dating method. The results found demonstrate that teachers judged useful/relevant visualize students' interaction with gamification elements such as missions, levels to help them understand the students' status, but did not evaluate the visualization of the interaction of students with the trophies relevant. Teachers also highly evaluated the creation of personalized missions for a student or a specific group as relevant to help demotivated students to engage and achieve the desired goals. Therefore, this study provides some relevant insights to guide the design and re-design of gamified adaptive learning systems."},{authors:"Anabil Munshi, Shitanshu Mishra, Ningyu Zhang, Luc Paquette, Jaclyn Ocumpaugh, Ryan Baker and Gautam Biswas.

The goal of this research is to determine how basic emotions relate to the achievement emotion states, which are considered to be more relevant in academic settings. Such relations, if accurate and consistent, may be leveraged to make more effective use of the commercial affect-detection software. For this study, we collected affect data over four days from a classroom study with 65 students using Betty’s Brain. Basic emotions obtained from commercial software were aligned to achievement emotions obtained using sensor-free models. Interpretable classifiers enabled the study of relationships between the two types of emotions. Our findings show that certain basic emotions can help infer complex achievement emotions such as confusion, frustration and engaged concentration. This suggests the possibility of using commercial software as a less context-sensitive and more development-friendly alternative to the affect detector models currently used in learning environments."},{authors:"Deniz Sonmez Unal, Kate Arrington, Erin Solovey and Erin Walker.

In this study, we present the results of crowdsourcing valuable insights into the underlying concepts of problems in mathematics and English writing, as a first step in leveraging the crowd to expedite the task of generating KCs. We presented crowdworkers with two problems in each domain and asked them to provide three explanations about why one problem is more challenging than the other. These explanations were then independently analyzed through (1) a series of qualitative coding methods and (2) several topic modeling techniques, to compare how they might assist in extracting KCs and other insights from the participant contributions. Results of our qualitative coding showed that crowdworkers were able to generate accurate KCs that matched those generated by domain experts. At the same time, the topic models’ outputs were evaluated against both the domain expert generated KCs and the results of the previous coding to determine effectiveness. Ultimately we found that while the topic modeling was not up to parity with the qualitative coding methods, it did assist in identifying useful clusters of explanations. This work demonstrates a method to leverage both the crowd’s knowledge and topic modeling to assist in the process of generating KCs for assessment items, which can be integrated in future learnersourced environments."},{authors:"Ayan Banerjee, Imane Lamrani and Sandeep Gupta.
