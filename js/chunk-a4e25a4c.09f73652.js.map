The main thrust of this approach is to orient towards envisioning new forms of human-AI partnerships, where humans collaborate with, talk to, or even confide in AI, and conversely, where AI, through its various guises, becomes a companion, therapist, colleague, assistant or other.

Her research interests are in the areas of ubiquitous computing, interaction design and human-computer \n                            interaction. A central theme of her work is concerned with designing interactive technologies that augment humans. A current \n                            focus of her research is on human data interaction. She is also interested in what human-centered AI means in practice. Central \n                            to her work is a critical stance towards how visions, theories and frameworks shape the fields of HCI, cognitive science and \n                            Ubicomp. She has been instrumental in promulgating new theories (e.g., external cognition), alternative methodologies (e.g., in \n                            the wild studies) and far-reaching research agendas (e.g., \n                            <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/hci2020/\">\"Being Human: HCI in 2020\"</a>).

In contrast, a new discourse is \n                            emerging that is rethinking the benefits of future AI advances from a more human perspective. The main thrust of this approach \n                            is to orient towards envisioning new forms of human-AI partnerships, where humans collaborate with, talk to, or even confide in \n                            AI, and conversely, where AI, through its various guises, becomes a companion, therapist, colleague, assistant or other. \n                            Such a shift in thinking enables researchers and developers to design quite different kinds of intelligent systems - those \n                            that augment humans. The implications of doing so are profound; especially when considering how to enhance the way learners, \n                            educators and teachers can collaborate with AI in the future. In my talk I will begin to describe what the opportunities and \n                            challenges are with this new framing for AI and Ed.\n                        </p>\n                    </div>\n\n                </div>\n                <hr />\n                <div class=\"row mt-5\">\n                    <div class=\"col-md-3 text-center\">\n                        <img class=\"rounded-circle img-fluid mb-5\" src=\"@/assets/keynotes/andreas.jpg\" />\n                        \n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"col-md-9\">\n                        <h2>Andreas Schleicher</h2>\n\n                        <p>\n                            Andreas Schleicher is Director for Education and Skills, and Special Advisor on Education Policy to\n                            the Secretary-General at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n                            He initiated and oversees the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and other\n                            international instruments, like the OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) and\n                            the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC), which create a global platform for policy-makers, researchers\n                            and educators to innovate and transform educational policies and practices.
