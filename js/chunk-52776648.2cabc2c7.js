As AI in Education systems get more mature and are implemented at scale in real-world contexts, the value of using AI systems in the service of human decision making, rather than automated personalisation, becomes more apparent than ever. While this paradigm of augmented intelligence is not new to the field,solid theoretical and/or empirical work in the area is limited. Further work is needed to understand the balance of human and artificial aspects in intelligence systems that involve human and AI partnerships. Developing and implementing AI-human hybrid systems requires new research and many questions remain to be answered. In this conference, we invite the community to think about intelligence augmentation opportunities that would empower key stakeholders of education and provide innovative and creative solutions supported with empirical evidence.
