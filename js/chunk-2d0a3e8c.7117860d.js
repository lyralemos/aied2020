These systems encounter two critical issues: 1) the initial lack of new learner's information for running complex services, and 2) new learners failing to actively interact with these complex services due to the initial unfamiliarity. We define such issues as the \"cold-start\" problem in today's intelligent tutoring systems, and propose a gamified solution to tackle it. By leveraging on the established MDA model, a three-layer framework with narrative elements and task-oriented elements is designed and implemented in an ITS for mathematics. The preliminary evaluations show its effectiveness, and the proposed solution is generally applicable to other ITS systems.

Korbit uses machine learning, natural language processing and reinforcement learning to provide interactive, personalized learning online. Korbit has been designed to easily scale to thousands of subjects, by automating, standardizing and simplifying the content creation process. Unlike other ITS, a teacher can develop new learning modules for Korbit in a matter of hours. To facilitate learning across a wide range of STEM subjects, Korbit uses a mixed-interface, which includes videos, interactive dialogue-based exercises, question-answering, conceptual diagrams, mathematical exercises and gamification elements. Korbit has been built to scale to millions of students, by utilizing a state-of-the-art cloud-based micro-service architecture. Korbit launched its first course in 2019 on machine learning, and since then over 5,000 students have enrolled. Although Korbit was designed to be open-domain and highly scalable, A/B testing experiments with real-world students demonstrate that both student learning outcomes and student motivation are substantially improved compared to typical online courses.
