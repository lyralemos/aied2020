In contrast, a new discourse is emerging that is rethinking the benefits of future AI advances from a more human perspective. The main thrust of this approach is to orient towards envisioning new forms of human-AI partnerships, where humans collaborate with, talk to, or even confide in AI, and conversely, where AI, through its various guises, becomes a companion, therapist, colleague, assistant or other. Such a shift in thinking enables researchers and developers to design quite different kinds of intelligent systems - those that augment humans. The implications of doing so are profound; especially when considering how to enhance the way learners, educators and teachers can collaborate with AI in the future.
